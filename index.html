      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hello! I'm Priyanshu Semwal, I hold a Master of Science (MSc) degree in Chemistry, where I specialized in various branches of chemistry including organic, inorganic, physical, and analytical chemistry. My academic journey has equipped me with a deep understanding of chemical principles and practical laboratory skills.
I am passionate about applying my knowledge to solve real-world problems, whether in academia, industry, or research institutions

            <h3>Water Quality Analysis</h3>
            <p>Sample Types:Grab Samples: Collected at a specific place and time, representing the water composition at that moment22.Composite Samples: A mixture of grab samples collected at the same point over different times, useful for observing average values333.Integrated Samples: A mixture of grab samples collected simultaneously from different points or depths (e.g., from both banks of a river) in equal volumes4.Collection and Storage:Samples should be collected in chemically clean, inert containers (glass or polythene)5.Precautions include collecting the sample $15 \text{ cm}$ below the surface and ensuring no physical activity is permitted upstream of the sampling point6.The time between collection and examination should be as short as possible7. Maximum storage limits are: Unpolluted water ($72$ hours), Slightly polluted ($48$ hours), and Heavily polluted ($12$ hours)8.Bacteriological samples require sterilization and must be examined immediately or stored at a low temperature for no more than $24$ hours9.II. Significance of Water Quality ParametersThe documents highlight the importance of measuring key physical and chemical parameters:Dissolved Oxygen (DO): Determines if biological processes are aerobic or anaerobic; low values adversely affect potability and can cause fish kill101010.Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) & Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD): Indicate the type and extent of organic matter pollution111111. $\text{BOD}$ measures oxygen required for biological stabilization, while $\text{COD}$ measures the demand through strong chemical oxidants121212121212.Solids (Residue): Total Suspended Solids ($\text{TSS}$) and Total Dissolved Solids ($\text{TDS}$) measure particulate matter. The test is important in sewage treatment to indicate the physical state of the principal constituents, which can be further categorized as volatile (organic) and fixed (inorganic)1313131313.pH, Alkalinity, and Acidity: Important for coagulation, softening, and corrosion control14.Hardness: Significant for industrial utilization (e.g., scale formation in boilers) and municipal supplies (soap consumption)15.Chloride Concentration: A change in concentration may be indicative of sewage pollution16.III. Specific Water Quality ExperimentsThe files outline the objectives, procedures, and calculations for several experiments:
