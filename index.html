### **Introduction to Water Sampling and Analysis**

[cite_start]The collection of a representative water sample is a critical first step in environmental analysis[cite: 4]. [cite_start]The accuracy of any subsequent analysis and the validity of conclusions and corrective actions depend entirely on the quality of the sample collection process[cite: 4]. [cite_start]Utmost care is necessary to ensure the sample accurately represents the body of water and to prevent contamination or spoilage during collection and transport[cite: 4].

#### **Types of Water Samples**

Depending on the specific requirements of the analysis, different types of samples may be collected:

* [cite_start]**Grab Samples:** These are single samples collected at a specific time and location[cite: 4]. [cite_start]They provide a snapshot of the water composition at that precise moment[cite: 4]. [cite_start]When dealing with sources that vary over time, such as industrial effluents, collecting multiple grab samples at different intervals can be highly valuable[cite: 4].
* [cite_start]**Composite Samples:** These are created by mixing grab samples collected from the same point but at different times[cite: 4]. [cite_start]Typically, samples are collected hourly in wide-mouthed bottles and mixed in volumes proportional to the flow, which is useful for determining average concentrations[cite: 4, 10].
* [cite_start]**Integrated Samples:** These are mixtures of grab samples taken from different points simultaneously[cite: 10]. [cite_start]For example, samples might be collected from both banks of a river at various depths and mixed in equal volumes to represent the overall condition of the water body[cite: 10].

#### **General Sampling Precautions**

* [cite_start]Samples should be collected in chemically clean glass bottles or inert polythene containers[cite: 10]. [cite_start]A 3.0-liter sample is generally sufficient for a standard examination[cite: 10].
* [cite_start]The sampling location must be representative of the water body and free of floating debris[cite: 10].
* [cite_start]Whenever possible, samples should be collected approximately 15 cm below the water surface[cite: 10].
* [cite_start]To avoid contamination, no physical activity should be permitted upstream of the sampling point during collection[cite: 10].
* [cite_start]The time between sample collection and analysis should be minimized[cite: 10]. Maximum storage times are recommended as follows:
    * [cite_start]Unpolluted Water: 72 hours [cite: 16]
    * [cite_start]Slightly Polluted Water: 48 hours [cite: 16]
    * [cite_start]Grossly Polluted Water: 12 hours [cite: 16]

### **Summary of Water Quality Experiments**

Here is an overview of the key physical, chemical, and biological parameters analyzed in the water samples.

#### **Experiment 1: Total Solids (Residue)**
* [cite_start]**Objective:** To determine the total, suspended, dissolved, volatile, and fixed solids in a water sample[cite: 53].
* [cite_start]**Theory:** Solids in water consist of particulate matter like algae, silt, clay, and minerals[cite: 53]. [cite_start]Total Suspended Solids (TSS) are particles retained by a filter, while Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) pass through[cite: 53]. [cite_start]This test is crucial in sewage treatment to understand the physical state of constituents[cite: 41].
* **Results:**
    * [cite_start]Total Residue: 2.1 mg/L [cite: 61]
    * Fixed Residue: 1.4 mg/L
    * Suspended Residue: 0.8 mg/L
    * Dissolved Residue: 1.2 mg/L

#### **Experiment 2: Turbidity**
* **Objective:** To determine the turbidity of the water sample.
* [cite_start]**Theory:** Turbidity, or the cloudiness of water, is caused by suspended particles like clay, silt, and microorganisms[cite: 22]. High turbidity can block sunlight, affecting the growth of aquatic plants and algae. [cite_start]It is measured using a nepheloturbidity meter, which detects light scattered by suspended particles[cite: 22].
* **Result:** The turbidity of the water sample was 95.5 NTU.

#### **Experiment 3: Acidity**
* **Objective:** To determine the extent of acidity in the water sample.
* [cite_start]**Theory:** Acidity in natural waters is primarily due to dissolved carbon dioxide ($CO_2$)[cite: 41]. [cite_start]In polluted water, mineral acids from industrial waste can also contribute[cite: 41]. [cite_start]Acidity is a measure of the water's capacity to neutralize bases[cite: 41].
* **Results:**
    * Mineral Acidity: 185 mg/L
    * $CO_2$ Acidity: 3 mg/L

#### **Experiment 4: Hardness**
* **Objective:** To estimate the hardness of the given water sample.
* [cite_start]**Theory:** Water hardness is caused by the presence of bivalent metallic ions, primarily calcium ($Ca^{++}$) and magnesium ($Mg^{++}$)[cite: 41]. [cite_start]Hardness is a concern for industrial uses, as it can cause scale formation in boilers, and for municipal supplies, as it increases soap consumption[cite: 41].
* **Results:**
    * Total Hardness: 58 mg/L
    * Permanent Hardness: 34 mg/L
    * Temporary Hardness: 24 mg/L

#### **Experiment 5: Chloride Concentration**
* **Objective:** To determine the chloride concentration in the water sample.
* [cite_start]**Theory:** Chlorides are present in all natural waters[cite: 41]. [cite_start]Since municipal sewage typically has a significantly higher chloride concentration (15-50 mg/L) than the water supply, a sudden change in chloride levels can indicate sewage pollution[cite: 41].
* **Result:** The chloride ion concentration was 37 mg/L.

#### **Experiment 6: Dissolved Oxygen (DO)**
* [cite_start]**Objective:** To determine the dissolved oxygen and percentage saturation of the water sample[cite: 83].
* [cite_start]**Theory:** Dissolved oxygen is a critical factor in determining whether biological processes in water are aerobic or anaerobic[cite: 47]. [cite_start]Low DO levels can negatively affect water potability and harm aquatic life, potentially causing fish kills[cite: 47].
* [cite_start]**Result:** The water sample contained 0.4 mg/L of dissolved oxygen[cite: 121].

#### **Experiment 7: Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD)**
* [cite_start]**Objective:** To determine the Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) of wastewater[cite: 128].
* [cite_start]**Theory:** BOD is the amount of oxygen required by bacteria to stabilize decomposable organic matter under aerobic conditions[cite: 128]. [cite_start]It serves as a key measure of the organic pollution content in water[cite: 128].
* [cite_start]**Result:** The BOD of the wastewater sample was 9.8 mg/L[cite: 159].

#### **Experiment 8: Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD)**
* [cite_start]**Objective:** To estimate the Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) of the given water sample[cite: 167].
* [cite_start]**Theory:** The COD test measures the pollution strength of wastewater by quantifying the amount of oxygen required to chemically oxidize nearly all organic compounds present[cite: 167].
* **Result:** The COD of the wastewater was 22 mg/L.

#### **Experiment 15: pH Value**
* **Objective:** To estimate the pH value of the given water sample.
* [cite_start]**Theory:** The pH scale measures the degree of acidity or alkalinity of a solution[cite: 41]. [cite_start]It is an "intensity factor" and is crucial for processes like coagulation, water softening, and corrosion control[cite: 41]. A pH meter, consisting of a glass electrode and a reference electrode, is used for the measurement.
* **Result:** The pH of the water sample was 7.5.

#### **Experiment 16: Alkalinity**
* **Objective:** To determine the carbonate, bicarbonate, and hydroxide alkalinity.
* **Theory:** Alkalinity is the water's capacity to neutralize acids and is primarily due to the presence of hydroxide ($OH^-$), carbonate ($CO_3^{2-}$), and bicarbonate ($HCO_3^-$) ions. The relative amounts of these are determined by the pH of the water.
* **Results:**
    * Phenolphthalein Alkalinity (P): 5 mg/L
    * Total Alkalinity (T): 80 mg/L
    * Alkalinity due to carbonates: 1 mg/L
    * Alkalinity due to bicarbonates: 7 mg/L
